HAL method demo
---------------
The desktop application demonstrates that
HAL semantic space model does work. Or doesn't.

Choose the distance metric, enter the word of interest
and find out what other words (stemmed tokens)
HAL considers to be semantically close to it
(e.g. if you enter the name, the first k tokens
should be names or pronouns).
